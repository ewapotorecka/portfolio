	short: <p>Climbing gives me chances to travel to all of the beautiful destinations, time spent in nature.
	It also gave me a chance to meet very different, but totally beautiful people including my husband.</p>,
	extended: <p>I’ve discovered climbing pretty late. I wasn’t a sport person.
	As a teenager my main sport activities were windsurfing in summer and snowboarding in winter.
	Not very „active” activities in my opinion. Climbing was a love at first sight.
	Honey moon phase lasted for about two years and then came the fear.
	Specifically the fear of falling, which blocked my development.
	I’m struggling till now. There are a lot of times that I’m so frustrated, that I want to quit.
	But something keeps me going. I love the movement, the state that you get in your head,
	when the only thing that matters is the next move, that you’re gonna make.</p>,
