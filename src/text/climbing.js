	short: <p>Climbing means for me active time in nature, traveling to beautiful destinations and meeting very different,
			but totally beautiful people. My husband I one of them :)</p>,
	extended: <p>I discovered climbing pretty late, I wasn’t a sport person.
				As a teenager I used to do windsurfing in summer and snowboarding in winter
				- not very active lifestyle in my opinion. Climbing was my love at first sight.
				Honey moon phase lasted for about two years and then came the fear.
				Specifically the fear of falling, which has blocked my development - I’m still struggling.
				Many times I’m so frustrated that I want to quit. But something keeps me going.
				I love the movement, the state that you get in your head when the only thing that matters is the next move you’re gonna make.</p>,
