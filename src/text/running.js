	short: <p>Long distance running brought many good changes to my life.
	Physically I feel much better, even when I’m tired.
	But most of the changes are in my head. This kind of activity gives you a lot of time to think,
	you discover yourself as a person, the traits that you never thought you have.
	I’ve became (or I always were?) very persistent in pursuing my goals, not only during training or races,
	in real-life situations too. I’m a master of planning and implementing the plans.
	Time management became my thing too, when I had to squeeze training, work, learning and household duties in one day.</p>,
	extended: <p>All my life I’ve hated running. Then COVID came and all of the climbing gyms were closed
	and I was looking for some kind of activity. My first runs were a total disaster (in my opinion)
	- I wasn’t able to run 4km without mixing it with walking. But as it turned out, I’m a totally persistent person.
	Soon came first 10km, which I thought was a very long distance. And then a climbing trip to Austrian Alps.
	A climbing trip, where I couldn’t climb because of a finger injury. So as before - I’ve continued with running, in mountains.
	I’ve always thought that long distance mountain runs is an activity for sick masochists.
	Imagine my surprise, when I made first 17km with 750m elevation and felt great.
	Long distance mountain runs turned out to be totally my activity.
	I’ve started training and finished my first run in September (27km).
	Right now I’m training to run my first ultra distance (something longer than marathon).</p>,
