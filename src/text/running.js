	short: <p>Long distance running brought many good changes to my life.
			Physically I feel much better, even when I’m tired. But most of the changes are in my head.
			This kind of activity gives you a lot of time to think, you discover yourself as a person,
			the traits that you never thought you have.
			I’ve became (or I always were?) very persistent in pursuing my goals,
			not only during training or races, in real-life situations too.
			I’m a master of planning and executing plans.
			Time management became my thing too, when I had to squeeze training, work, learning and household duties in one day.</p>,
	extended: <p>In the past I hated running. Then COVID came and all of the climbing gyms were closed,
				so I was looking for some kind of alternative. My first runs were disaster (in my opinion) -
				I wasn’t able to run 4km without walking breaks. But it turned out I’m a totally persistent person.
				Soon I made my first 10km, which I thought to be a long distance. And then I went on a climbing trip to Austrian Alps,
				where I couldn’t climb because of a finger injury. So instead I continued running, this time in mountains.
				I used to think that long distance mountain running is an activity for sick masochists.
				Imagine my surprise, when I made first 17km with 750m elevation and felt great.
				Long distance mountain running turned out to be totally my activity.
				I’ve started training and finished my first run in September (27km).
				Right now I’m training to run my first ultra distance (something longer than marathon).</p>,
