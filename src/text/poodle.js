				They say that Poodles are among most intelligent dogs. And yes they are.
				Even if they learn super fast, that doesn't mean, that they will obey every command.
				First the Poodle will think - is it worth the effort. If you watch closely, you will see the process.
				Then Poodle will try to do the command only halfway and see if it works.
				I would never thought that there are so many intermediate states between sitting and laying down.
				So I have a standard poodle. The most wonderful dog in the world. Full of love and excitement.
				And full of personality. Every day he teaches me patience, trust and shows what unconditional love is.

			I’m a dog person. My last dog was an English bulldog - not very active kind of dog.
			After her me and my boyfriend (husband now) decided to get a dog, that will fit our lifestyle -
			lots of travelling and activities. After meeting our friends poodle, we’ve decided that the breed is a perfect choice.
			We gave him a name Forest and that’s not the coincidence - when he was young he had only two states: he stood,
			like he was frozen or he run. Hence the name (remember „Forest Gump”?). I could write the whole book about Forest.
			Poodles are believed to be second smartest dogs. And I think that’s true. If you add very strong personality,
			a clear opinion of what he wants and total hyperactivity - you get Forest.
		</p>
		<p>
			I’ve always imagined me climbing and my dog waiting calmly under the rock - not my dog,
			Forest will be barking and protecting „his” rock from other people.
			Me running and my dog running with me - not my dog too. Forest loves running, but he has some preferences
			- morning runs are not for him, he prefers to run with two people and most of all he’s a sprinter,
			but we are working on his long distance endurance.
			Me walking in the park and my dog happily playing with other dogs - even that is not my dog.
			Forest loves other dogs but he gets so excited, that it is not pleasant nor safe for other dogs.
		</p>
		<p>
			So my dog is not perfect. But I love him with all my heart. When he lies down on my lap
			(he still thinks, that he is small dog) all of his faults go away. Forest is a unique. He loves to travel.
			He was already in France, Austria, Slovenia and many places in Poland. When he’s happy he jumps on two feet
			(sometimes problematic giving his size, but adorable). He loves to cuddle and sit on my lap.
			Forest has a perfect smell and enjoys using it. We can hide his toy around the house and he will always find it.
			He’s great in communicating - he can always show, when he wants something,
			and even more clearly when he doesn’t want to do something.
		</p>
		<p>
			Right now I’m spending lots of my time on teaching Forest that he can control himself in many situations.
			I’ve done a lots of reading on reactivity in dogs. Forest even has some dog friends -
			he only needs some more time to control his joy.
