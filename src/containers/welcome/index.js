				<h2>Welcome!</h2>
				<p>My name is Ewa and I'm happy to shortly present myself.</p>
				<p>Professionally I want to become a JavaScript Developer. I've been learning JavaScript since 2019.
					Right now I'm taking part in React intensive course ("Szko≈Ça Reacta") and totally love this library!</p>

					By profession I am a psychologist.
					For more than 10 years I worked with autistic children and their families, helping also with behavioral difficulties.
					I became responsible for coordinating the work of other therapists in the kindergarten that employed me,
					I also worked with parents and solved conflicts arising in this difficult environment.
